Geoffrey Big's efforts

For his original effort at converting to python and also including some patches:

==================== RosTime ====================
  
== Against ==

Files: include/ros/time.h include/ros/duration.h src/ros/time.cpp
Last Changed Revisions: 12080

== Summary ==

Windows dropins for getting the time and sleeping.
code for catching the time (already there, just needed to edit out the 
ROS_INFO) and nanosleep (provided by Geoff Biggs).

== Mingw Fixes ==

- duration.h, ros.h
  - remove the #include <windows.h>, doesn't seem to need it.
  
- time.cpp
  - drop out now broken ROS_INFO calls.
  - drop in Geoffrey Biggs nanosleep replacement.
  - fix Geoffrey's bugs in the sleep code.
  - convert WIN32 to _WIN32 macros (ms visual express 2010 doesn't define WIN32).
  
== ToDo ==

clock_gettime and nanosleep could probably be set up with their own proper cross platform
function definitions rather than having a scattering of ifdefs.

==================== RosConsole ====================

== Against ==

File : CMakeLists.txt, include/ros/assert.h, include/ros/console.h
Last Changed Revisions: 12943, 8377, 12775
  
== Summary ==

Just put in a special case for mingw, not windows debug breaks.

== Mingw ==

- CMakeLists.txt
  - temporary fix to make example.exe build, had to link by hand ach.
- assert.h
  - ifdef for mingw using DebugBreak instead of msvc's __debugbreak().
- console.h
  - mingw needs to include <cstdarg> in order to find va_list type.
