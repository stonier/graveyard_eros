Last Changed Revision: 12775, Jan 06, 2011
Ticket: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3334
Modification: 
  Patch Set I : These were patched in trunk (not diamondback).
    
  - CMakeLists.txt
    - temporary fix to make example.exe build, had to link by hand ach.
  - assert.h
    - ifdef for mingw using DebugBreak instead of msvc's __debugbreak().
  - console.h
    - mingw needs to include <cstdarg> in order to find va_list type.
  - rosconsole.cpp
    - remove shell colours in windows (probably has a different notation?)
    
  Patch Set II : These are not patched but probably also will not be ticketed as
  rosbuild2 is coming. They are simply tools to help find log4cxx's dependencies.
