===== Rospack =====

== Against ==

- Last Changed Rev: 12709
- Last Changed Date: 2011-01-01 03:36:33 +0900 (Sat, 01 Jan 2011)
- Geoff's patch: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3274

== Summary ==

These contain alot of filesystem functions that may be better off moved to
something portable like boost::filesystem rather than maintaining it ourselves.
However, that's not so practical right now as boost::filesystem is transitioning from
version 2 to version 3 over boost versions 1.44 -> 1.47. Maybe later?

== Mingw Fixes ==

- rospack.cpp and rosstack.cpp
  - added definition for PATH_MAX.
  - no mkstemp, so just dropping back to calling tmpfile()
- main.cpp
  - skip the sudo check for win32 systems.

== ToDo ==

Is it safe to use the insecure version for both mingw and unix?
    
===== RosTime =====
  
== Against ==

Files: include/ros/time.h  src/ros/time.cpp
  Last Changed Author: jfaust
  Last Changed Rev: 12080

== Summary ==

Windows dropins for getting the time and sleeping.
code for catching the time (already there, just needed to edit out the 
ROS_INFO) and nanosleep (provided by Geoff Biggs).

== Mingw Fixes ==

- time.cpp
  - drop out now broken ROS_INFO calls.
  - drop in Geoffrey Biggs nanosleep replacement.
  
== ToDo ==

clock_gettime and nanosleep could probably be set up with their own proper cross platform
function definitions rather than having a scattering of ifdefs.

===== RosConsole =====

== Against ==

File : rosconsole/include/ros/assert.h
  Last Changed Author: jfaust
  Last Changed Rev: 8377
  
== Summary ==

Just put in a special case for mingw, not windows debug breaks.

== Mingw ==

- assert.h
  - ifdef for mingw using DebugBreak instead of msvc's __debugbreak().
