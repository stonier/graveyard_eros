===== Rospack =====

== Against ==

- Last Changed Rev: 12709
- Last Changed Date: 2011-01-01 03:36:33 +0900 (Sat, 01 Jan 2011)

== Summary ==

These contain alot of filesystem functions that may be better off moved to
something portable like boost::filesystem rather than maintaining it ourselves.
However, that's not so practical right now as boost::filesystem is transitioning from
version 2 to version 3 over boost versions 1.44 -> 1.47. Maybe later?

== Mingw Fixes ==

- rospack.cpp and rosstack.cpp
  - added definition for PATH_MAX.
  - no mkstemp, so just dropping back to calling tmpfile(), can we use this for 
    both mingw and unix rather than the secure version?
- main.cpp
  - skip the sudo check for win32 systems.
