\section packageSummary Package Summary

	This provides a source package for cross-compiling a gdb/gdbserver combo.
	
	This pair of tools allows you to do remote debugging without having
	to run the debugger itself (nor libs with debugging symbols) on the
	target. Very useful for embedded boards with limited memory or oomph.

\section ChangeLog

	- <b>Oct 10</b> : Done and road tested.
